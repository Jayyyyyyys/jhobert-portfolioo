            <h1>I am Jhobert,</h1>
            <p> a political science graduate and a juris doctor student with a strong interest in law, public discourse, and social transformation. My work and studies are grounded in critical analysis, careful writing, and an engagement with ideas that sit at the intersection of policy, justice, and lived experience. Through debate and research, I’ve developed a disciplined approach to argumentation and a reflective voice shaped by both academic rigor and personal growth. I value clarity, restraint, and depth, and I am most drawn to work that demands thoughtfulness, integrity, and a willingness to question power and assumptions.</p>
